# Depth Estimation for AI in Autonomous Driving 

## Overview
This project focuses on stereo vision-based depth estimation, a crucial aspect of AI-powered autonomous driving. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the system computes 3D depth maps from stereo images, enabling machines to perceive the real world with human-like depth perception.
## Key Features and Results

 **Stereo Vision Processing** â€“ Uses dual-camera images to estimate depth.
 **Disparity Map Calculation** â€“ Generates disparity maps to measure depth perception.
 **Real-Time Depth Estimation** â€“ Optimized for speed and efficiency in self-driving applications.
 **Obstacle Detection & Scene Understanding** â€“ Aids in safe navigation and path planning.

Below are some results I got from the project:
